# Garrys-Mod-Zombie-Survival

This open source repository of scripts I have written up for maps in Garry's Mod Zombie Survival are free to use by anyone under the condition that credit is given to me since getting the vectors and finding the triggers inside of maps and editing them is time consuming. So please leave the credits function inside the scripts and give credit where it is due, By keeping these credits in motivates me to keep fixing maps. (I did decide to do this for free after all.)

Removing/altering the credits hook is a violation to the AGPLv3 License i have released these scripts under. (You have been warned.) Refer to the LICENSE file in the root directory for more information.


Install these map profiles to the following directory you have zombie survival installed upon your local pc or server.
"/garrysmod/gamemodes/zombiesurvival/gamemode/maps/*.lua"
