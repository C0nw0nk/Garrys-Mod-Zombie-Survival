# Garrys-Mod-Zombie-Survival

This open source repository of scripts (map profiles) I have written up for maps in Garry's Mod Zombie Survival are free to use by anyone under the condition that credit is given to me since getting the vectors and finding the triggers inside of maps and editing them is time consuming. So please leave the credits function inside the scripts and give credit where it is due, By keeping these credits in motivates me to keep fixing maps.
